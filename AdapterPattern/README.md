Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with
incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
<br>
An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexi-
ty of conversion happening behind the scenes. The wrapped
object isn’t even aware of the adapter. For example, you can
wrap an object that operates in meters and kilometers with an
adapter that converts all of the data to imperial units such as
feet and miles.

Adapters can not only convert data into various formats but
can also help objects with different interfaces collaborate.
it’s even possible to create a two-way adapter that
can convert the calls in both directions.
